Therefore, it follows that only you can ever know you and only I can ever know I 
directly. Between your consciousness and mine,there exists a wide gap that cannot be 
bridged. We may work together, live together, come to love or hate each other. But our 
mind can never be understood entirely by other people. We must live our own lives, 
think our own thoughts, and arrive at our own destiny.
