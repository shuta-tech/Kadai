The American soldier has a dangerous job  but some soldiers perform jobs that put their lives in danger all the time  We can use military robots to Cross through minefields  disarming bombs  clear mines and caves in which soldiers have to do  By using robots we can keep soldiers out of harm   s way  we also use robots to do these dangerous jobs  Using robots to conduct these types of dangerous jobs saves lives  instead of losing the life of a soldier we would only lose an expensive piece of equipment in which we can replace  The rising interest in robots in the late     s coincided with changing political winds a shrinking U S  military as part of the post Cold War so called    peace dividend     and an increasing belief that public tolerance for military risk and casualties had dropped dramatically after the relatively costless victory in the Gulf War  In       this was the main factor that led Senator John Warner  R  Va    then chairman of the Armed Services Committee  to mandate in the Pentagon   s budget that by       one third of all the aircraft designed to attack behind enemy lines be unmanned  and that by       one third of all ground combat vehicles be driverless  And then came September           The annual national defense budget since      has risen to      billion  an increase of    percent between      and        not counting the cost of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq  There has been a massive increase in spending on research and development and on procurement  with a particular focus on anything unmanned     Make    em as fast as you can    is what one robotics executive recounts being told by his Pentagon buyers after       Enthusiasm has only grown thanks to successes on the battlefield 

The important thing about military robots is that they are built to assist soldiers on the battlefield  Some of these robots are built to be carried by the soldier helping them to complete their mission  Having these robots have protected soldiers from dangerous situation and lessen the risk of putting soldiers into harm   s way  Military robots play a very important part in combat operations throughout the world  By having such robotic technology it has notably made the U S  military a superior power in the world having such technology has significantly increased our military standing as being one of the most powerful militaries in the world  The army   s race during the cold war generated some of the greatest technological achievements in human history   If our military stop spending money on robotic technology  we put our country at risk 

Medical robots
Next  the medical robot is helping to change the medical field  A medical robot has become one of the most beneficial robots in the world  These robots are used to train surgeons  assist in difficult and precise surgical procedures  and to assist patients in recovery  Medical robots are used in a range of medical practices  including difficult and precise surgical procedures  Medical robots are equipped with a computer integrated technology that contains a complex of programmed languages  controllers  and advanced sensors  Medical robots are currently being used for training surgeons and providing detailed information to students  These robots offers routine procedure  which cut down on the time needed to perform any medical operation  These robots provide accurate placement and limited movement that can help to improved surgical procedures  Robot assisted surgery provides many benefits in the surgical care of patients  Computer assisted robots provide exact motion and trajectories to minimize the side effects of surgical intervention  Surgeon guided robotics allows the surgeon to access patient anatomy with smaller incisions  The medical robot offers medical personnel a major advantage in precision and efficiency in medical operations  A medical robot gives doctors the ability to view medical records  view X rays  interact with patience   s  and to view test results  Although robots cannot actually check patients they  give doctors the ability to have social interaction with each other by using a screen attached to the medical robot
